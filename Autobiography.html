                <div class="description">My name is Chloe Nicole T. Serrano, 17 from Loma de Gato, Marilao Bulacan. I was born on 8th  of November, 2006. I’m currently SHS student taking GAS strand at CAM. We are 4 members in the family, my mother named Catherine Serrano, my father Jeffrey Serrano and my younger brother Jeremiah Serrano. Growing up I foster and appreciate fellowship, That's why the warmth of family gatherings and laughter with friends bring me the most happiness. I also love travel and adventures, in fact, my dream job is to be a flight attendant someday and with that being said, I get to continuously develop my skills with determination and passion in building connection and impact. Now I’m currently pursuing what I love which is pageantry, which help me develop  myself in to something greater and a women who transcend and strides with a purpose. In my journey ahead, I hope that my love ones will still be there for I will never forget to look and give back. That’s why no matter where fate leades me I will always do my best and never give up for I believe that the “true winner is a dreamer who never gives up.”
